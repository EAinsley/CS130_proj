\section*{PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT}

\begin{aspect}{DATA STRUCTURES}
	\begin{qc}
		A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed \lstinline{struct} or member,
		global or static variable, \lstinline{typedef}, or enumeration.
		Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
	\end{qc}

\end{aspect}

\begin{aspect}{ALGORITHMS}

	\begin{qc}
		A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for accessing the data stored in the SPT about a given page.
	\end{qc}

	\begin{qc}
		A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between kernel and user virtual addresses
		that alias a single frame,
		or alternatively how do you avoid the issue?
	\end{qc}
\end{aspect}

\begin{aspect}{SYNCHRONIZATION}
	\begin{qc}
		A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
		how are races avoided?
	\end{qc}
\end{aspect}

\begin{aspect}{RATIONALE}
	\begin{qc}
		A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did
		for representing virtual-to-physical mappings?
	\end{qc}
\end{aspect}
