\section*{MEMORY MAPPED FILES}

\begin{aspect}{DATA STRUCTURES}
	\begin{qc}
		C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed \lstinline{struct} or member,
		global or static variable, \lstinline{typedef}, or enumeration.
		Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
	\end{qc}

\end{aspect}


\begin{aspect}{ALGORITHMS}
	\begin{qc}
		C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual memory subsystem.
		Explain how the page fault and eviction processes differ between swap pages and other pages.
	\end{qc}

	\begin{qc}
		C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps any existing segment.
	\end{qc}

\end{aspect}

\begin{aspect}{RATIONALE}
	\begin{qc}
		C4: Mappings created with \lstinline{mmap} have similar semantics to those of data demand-paged from executables,
		except that \lstinline{mmap} mappings are written back to their original files, not to swap.
		This implies that much of their implementation can be shared.
		Explain why your implementation either does or does not share much of the code for the two situations.
	\end{qc}
