\section*{SUBDIRECTORIES}

\begin{aspect}{DATA STRUCTURES}
	\begin{qc}
		B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed \lstinline{struct} or member,
		global or static variable, \lstinline{typedef}, or enumeration.
		Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
	\end{qc}
\end{aspect}

\begin{aspect}{ALGORITHMS}
	\begin{qc}
		B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
		do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?
	\end{qc}
\end{aspect}

\begin{aspect}{SYNCHRONIZATION}
	\begin{qc}
		B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
		only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
		should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
		create a file with the same name, and so on.
	\end{qc}
	\begin{qc}
		B5: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it
		is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current
		working directory?  If so, what happens to that process's future
		file system operations?  If not, how do you prevent it?
	\end{qc}
\end{aspect}


\begin{aspect}{RATIONALE}
	\begin{qc}
		B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
		process the way you did.
	\end{qc}
\end{aspect}
