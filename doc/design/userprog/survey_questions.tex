\begin{aspect}{SURVEY QUESTIONS}
	Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the course in future quarters.
	Feel free to tell us anything you wantthese questions are just to spur your thoughts.
	You may also choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of the quarter.

	\begin{qc}
		In your opinion,
		was this assignment, or any one of the three problems in it, too easy or too hard?
		Did it take too long or too little time?
	\end{qc}
	It's not hard, but it's very tedious. It took too little time.

	\begin{qc}
		Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment
		gave you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?
	\end{qc}
	Yes. We found it's very import to do exhaustive checking on arguments passing to the kernel, especially for the pointer.

	\begin{qc}
		Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in future quarters
		to help them solve the problems?
		Conversely, did you find any of our guidance to be misleading?
	\end{qc}
	Yes. In system call, the implementation and expected behaviour is too vague. Details are missing on how the function behaves when an error occurs.

	\begin{qc}
		Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist students,
		either for future quarters or the remaining projects?
	\end{qc}
Please respond to students more promptly on piazza.
	\begin{qc}
		Any other comments?
	\end{qc}
  No.
