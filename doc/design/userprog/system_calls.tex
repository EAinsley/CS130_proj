	Add to \lstinline{proc_record}
	\begin{lstlisting}
struct list fd_list; // list used to record file descriptors.
struct file *image;  // the image of self.
	\end{lstlisting}
	\lstinline{fd_list} is the list used to store the mapping from \lstinline{fd} to \lstinline{file}. \lstinline{image} is used to store the location of the code of the process.
	\begin{lstlisting}
// The struct to record the fd and file mapping.
struct fd_node
{
  int fd;         // file descriptor
  struct file *f; // file
  struct list_elem fd_elem;
};
	\end{lstlisting}
\lstinline{fd_node} is the node in the \lstinline{fd_list}.\\
Add to syscall.c
\begin{lstlisting}
/* Locks for the filesystem */
struct lock filesys_lock;
\end{lstlisting}	
\lstinline{filesys_lock} is used to lock the filesystem to prevent intervention. We have also defined an atomic operation for the file system. 
\begin{lstlisting}
#define ATOMIC_FS_OP                                                          \
  for (int i = (lock_acquire (&filesys_lock), 0); i < 1;                      \
       lock_release (&filesys_lock), i++)
\end{lstlisting}
	\begin{qc}
		B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
		Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a single process?
	\end{qc}
	We add a \lstinline{fd_list} for each process. When the process open a new file, we find the minimal unsed fd, and insert fd with the file into the list. When the process close the file, we remove the related node from the list. We also use dynamic memory allocation and carefully handled all the sections related to the memory allocation. When the process exits, the \lstinline{fd_list} will be cleared and deallocate.\\
	The file descriptors are unique within a single process.

		B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the kernel.

	\TODO{read/write syscall implementation}

	\begin{qc}
		B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data to be copied from user space into the kernel.
		What is the least and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table (e.g. calls to \lstinline{pagedir_get_page()}) that might result?
		What about for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?
		Is there room for improvement in these numbers, and how much?
	\end{qc}

	\begin{qc}
		B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the \lstinline{wait} system call
		and how it interacts with process termination.
	\end{qc}
	\TODO{wait syscall impl}

	\begin{qc}
		B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address can fail due to a bad pointer value.
		Such accesses must cause the process to be terminated.
		System calls are fraught with such accesses,
		e.g. a \lstinline{write} system call requires reading the system call number from the user stack,
		then each of the call's three arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of these can fail at any point.
		This poses a design and error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary function of code in a morass of error-handling?
		Furthermore, when an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?
		In a few paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for managing these issues.
		Give an example.
	\end{qc}
	We use the function provided by in the PintOS project document.
	\begin{lstlisting}
/* Reads a byte at user virtual address UADDR.
UADDR must be below PHYS_BASE.
Returns the byte value if successful, -1 if a segfault
occurred. */
static int32_t
get_user (const uint8_t *uaddr)
{
  // accessing a kernel space memory, reject
  if (!((void *)uaddr < PHYS_BASE))
    return -1;

  int result;
  asm("movl $1f, %0; movzbl %1, %0; 1:" : "=&a"(result) : "m"(*uaddr));
  return result;
}
	\end{lstlisting}
Currently a \emph{Base and Bound} virtual memory mechanism is implemented for PintOS.
The physics memory address below \lstinline{PHYS_BASE} are reserved for the kernel and the higher addresses are used for user processes.

We should prevent reading from or writting to addresses below \lstinline{PHYS_BASE}.
As for accesses to memory addresses higher than \lstinline{PHYS_BASE}, we should also check if the address belongs to current process.

We implemented two helper functions \lstinline{get_user(addr)} and \lstinline{put_user(addr, byte)}
which validate the address before accessing the memory and handles possible memory permission error after the access.
These functions enable us to focus on implementation of functionalities without being obscured by the tedious memory address validation.

For any pointer, we will check NULL value and its address. If the pointer points to a string, we will check it byte by byte until we met the string end (or exceed the bound). If an error is detected, we will terminate the process. This invoke \lstinline{thread_exit}, in which we will clean up the memory. As for the \lstinline{file_lock}, we restricted the atomic operation to the minimal size and only acquire the lock after all the checking has passed. Therefore, when the process exit, the lock will not be in the busy state.

For examble, if we pass an invalid pointer to our \lstinline{write} syscall.
\begin{lstlisting}
static int
SYSCALL_FN (write) (int fd, const void *buffer, unsigned size)
{
  // Check pointer, head and tail
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < size; i++)
    check_user_valid_ptr (buffer + i);

  // Handle write to console.
  if (fd == 1)
    {
      putbuf (buffer, size);
      return size;
    }
  // Read file
  struct file *fp = get_current_open_file (fd);
  // Write file.
  int result = 0;
  ATOMIC_FS_OP { result = file_write (fp, buffer, size); }
  return result;
}
\end{lstlisting}
The error will be caught in \lstinline{check_user_valid_ptr}
\begin{lstlisting}
/* Check whethter the give pointer is valid in user space.  */
static void
check_user_valid_ptr (const void *ptr)
{
  if (ptr == NULL || get_user (ptr) == -1)
    err_exit ();
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
/* process exit on error */
static void
err_exit ()
{
  thread_current ()->proc->proc_status = PROC_ERROR_EXIT;
  SYSCALL_FN (exit) (-1);
}
\end{lstlisting}
This will invoke \lstinline{exit} syscall, which will call \lstinline{thread_exit}
\begin{lstlisting}
static void
SYSCALL_FN (exit) (int status)
{
  struct proc_record *proc = thread_current ()->proc;
  if (proc != NULL)
    {
      proc->proc_status = PROC_NORMAL_EXIT;
      proc->exit_code = status;
    }
  thread_exit ();
}
\end{lstlisting}
In which we call \lstinline{process_exit}. In the below section
\begin{lstlisting}
/* Destroy the current process's page directory and switch back to the
   kernel-only page directory.

   Correct ordering here is crucial.  We must set cur->pagedir to NULL before
   switching page directories, so that a timer interrupt can't switch back to
   the process page directory.  We must activate the base page directory
   before destroying the process's page directory, or our active page
   directory will be one that's been freed (and cleared).
*/
uint32_t *pd = cur->pagedir;
cur->pagedir = NULL;
pagedir_activate (NULL);
pagedir_destroy (pd);

// Allow write and close file.
if (cur->proc->image != NULL)
	{
		file_allow_write (cur->proc->image);
		file_close (cur->proc->image);
	}

// NOTE - Memory freed here!
fd_list_clear (&cur->proc->fd_list);
// orphran deallocate process record structure
if (cur->proc->orphan)
	palloc_free_page ((void *)cur->proc);
cur->proc = NULL;
\end{lstlisting}
all the allocated resources will be deallocated. Also we can notice that this error detection happens before \lstinline|ATOMIC_FS_OP { result = file_write (fp, buffer, size); }|, that is the lock haven't been acquired, therefore, we don't have to worry about releasing it.

		B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the kernel in the way that you did?

	\TODO{accessing user memory from kernel}

	\begin{qc}
		B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design for file descriptors?
	\end{qc}
	Each process has its own \lstinline{fd_list}, so the file descriptors in different process are isolated. This will make our system more robust. Since we use a dynamically increased list for our file descriptors, memory usage will be more efficient. The disadvantage is that we use list to store the mapping between file descriptors and files, we have to iterate through the whole list to find the fd. If we could use a dynamically increasing hash table, it will be faster as well as maintaining the memory usage. However, it will be much more comlicated than our current implementation.
